  2. Lambda functions

  Questions:
      Why are functions first class objects?
      Write a lambda function that doubles and returns any number (data-type) passed to it
      How will you sort a dictionary by its value in reverse order? (and return as list of tuples)


  # Callback functions
  def add(n1, n2):
      return n1 + n2

  add(1, 2)

  def mul(n1, n2):
      return n1 * n2

  def calculator(num1, num2, function):
      result = function(num1, num2)     # third arg function is called with first two args
      print(result)

  def first_item(sequence):
      return sequence[0]

  def second_item(sequence):
      return sequence[1]

  d = {'messages': 1, 'requests': 2, 'notifs': 3}

  def print_dict_item(dictionary, func=first_item):
      """ Prints the keys of each dictionary key-value pair"""
      dict_items = dictionary.items()    # key-value pair as List of tuples form

      for key_value_tuple in dict_items:
          key = func(key_value_tuple)
          print(key)


  print_dict_item(d, func=second_item)
  print_dict_item(d, func=second_item)


  # Lambda functions
  Lambda Expressions
     - Lambda functions can be used wherever function objects are required
     - They are restricted to a single expression

     Syntax:
         <function name> = lambda x [,y] [,z]: <expression>                # note: there is no return keyword

  add_ten = lambda a : a + 10   # one argument
  print(add_ten(5))

  mail_id = lambda f_name, l_name, c_name: '{}.{}@{}.com'.format(f_name, l_name, c_name)
  print(mail_id('john', 'doe', 'company'))


  # Simple examples
  average = lambda l: sum(l) / len(l) # calculate average of numbers in a list
  average([10, 10, 10, 10])


  # Sort dictionary by value
  people_count_dict = {
      'hcl': 1000,
      'tcs': 1200,
      'cts': 650,
      'wipro': 700
  }

  # Normal sorting
  sorted(people_count_dict)   # sorts company names in alphabetical order

  # To sort by values
  # 1. Use sorted() function on dict.items() -> list of tuples [(a, b), (c, d), ...]
  # 2. Pass the keyword argument 'key' as the lambda function.
       lambda x: x[1]

  sorted(people_count_dict.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
  sorted(people_count_dict.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

Summary:
  1. Generators
     a. Difference between Iteration and iterables

        Iteration:
              - Iteration is the repetition of some kind of process over and over again 
              - Example: iteration over a list in a "for" loop 


#code           
ez_string = "Generators"
for s in ez_string:
    print(s)
    

        Iterable:
          - Any object that is iterated over is called iterable
          - Example:
              - list
              - str 
              - dict 
              - set 


      b. What are generators?

Questions:

1 - How to create a generator in Python?
2 - Differences between Generator function and a Normal function
3 - When is StopIteration error thrown?
4 - Create a generator function to compute the power of 2 for the given numbers 
 
          - Generators are iterables like list or tuple but generated one at a time 
          - It generates values one at a time from a given sequence
          - Since they load only one item at a time, they are highly memory efficient 
          - You can use the generated values using a for loop or with next function
          - It is a function usually created using a for (or while) loop 
          
          Syntax: 

            1. Simple example 
                def <generator name>():
                    yield <variable>

def alpha_generator():
    yield 'a'

>>> alpha = alpha_generator()
>>> next(alpha)
'a'
>>>
>>>
>>> next(alpha)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
StopIteration
      

            2. Functional example without loops 

def gen_printer():
    n = 1
    print('This is printed first')
    yield n   # returns the value and the state is stored
    
    n += 1
    print('This is printed second')
    yield n   # returns the value and the state is stored

    n += 1
    print('This is printed at last')
    yield n   # returns the value and the state is stored


>>> printer = gen_printer()
>>>
>>> next(printer)
This is printed first
1
>>> next(printer)
This is printed second
2
>>> next(printer)
This is printed at last
3
>>> next(printer)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
StopIteration              
                    
            3. Functional example with loops
                def <generator name>():
                    for item in sequence:
                      yield <item>        # state of the item is store between subsequent calls 
                
Example:

# create a generator that returns square of given numbers 

def square_generator(max_limit, start=0):
    for number in range(start, max_limit + 1):
        yield number ** 2

>>>
>>> sq = square_generator(10)
>>> for s in sq:
...     print(s)



# create a generator that returns line by line from a large scattered text if 

def generate_lines():
    text = """ACP Milind Khetle said Sam called his wife in Sydney, Australia, and
----------
told her he was going to end his life. His wife immediately informed the British 
==========
deputy high commission in Mumbai. Officials from the foreign mission informed the police control room
19999999999991232
A team led by ACP Khetle immediately swung into action and reached the address in Hiranandani Gardens
**************

    for line in text.split('\n'):
        if '-' in line or '==' in line or line.isdigit() or '*' in line:
            continue
        yield line 

>>>
>>> gen = generate_lines()
>>>
>>> for l in gen:
...     print(l)



Memory efficient

A normal function to return a sequence will create the entire sequence in memory before returning the result. This is an overkill if the number of items in the sequence is very large.

Generator implementation of such sequence is memory friendly and is preferred since it only produces one item at a time.
