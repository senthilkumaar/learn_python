String Operations

7. Create a string variable 'text' and print it. The
   output should be: Hello World

   Sample:
       text = '...'
       print(...)

8. Create a string variable 'special_string' and print it. The
   output should be:

   Python is an "object-oriented" Programming language

9. Create a string variable 'multiline_string' and print it. The
   output should be a multiline string with one line spacing.

   Hint: You may use triple quoted string instead of \n new line character

   line 1: Unlike other high level languages
   line 2: <blank line>
   line 3: Python is interpreted

10. Create a string variable "news" with value below:
    Air travel to become bit costlier as govt announces hike in aviation security fee from July 1

    Question: Using string slicing print the below values:
              Air travel
              July 1

    Sample:
      print(news[:n])   # empty index at left of : denotes start
      print(news[-n:])  # empty index at right of : denotes end

11. Given two string below:

    job_title = "job requirement"
    certs = "certifications in administration is desired"
    added_certs = "additional certifications as below is a plus but not required"
    skills_1 = "azure, windows server"
    skills_2 = "aws, dotnet"

    Use string methods to
      1. capitalize start of each word in job_title
      2. capitalize the first letter of the string certs
      3. capitalize the string completely added_certs
      4. Make the start of each word in skills_1 capitalized
      5. Make the all the words capitalized skills_2

12. Create a format string with placeholders "{}" and then,
    Make use of string format function to print the error and error code as below:

    Error occurred during data extraction. Error code is: 121
    Error occurred during string manipulation. Error code is: 221

    where,
      "data extraction and 121" is the formatted string in first example
      "string manipulation and 221" is the formatted string in second example
